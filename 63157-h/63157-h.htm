    <div class="verse indentq">“They are coming back in might,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Olympic gods, to claim their ancient right.</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this practical age it is not to be supposed that busy people
in general have time to make a thorough study of mythologic
science: but to share understandingly the love of sculpture now
awakened in the public mind, and for a better appreciation of our
galleries of casts, it is desirable to have at least a suggestive knowledge
of the myths and legends which have inspired so many artists
in the moulding of their statues, <span class="locked">for—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Even in ruins of their marble limbs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They breathe of that far world wherefrom they came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of liquid light and harmonies serene,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lost halls of heaven and fair Olympian air.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this book the aim has been to introduce some of the best
specimens of mythologic sculpture to those who wish to become
acquainted with things which add to the resources of a happy
imagination, but who find it impracticable to study set treatises on
“fossil theology,” or to consider the historical development of art.</p>

<p>An unpretentious exposition of the myths has been given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
together with their popular interpretations. The poets, ever the
best commentators on mythology and sculpture, are freely quoted.
These metrical lines, relating either to the statues or the stories,
may serve to stamp indelibly on the mind facts otherwise effaceable.</p>

<p>A table of Greek and Roman synonymous deities and a list of
suggestive readings in modern literature are appended.</p>

<p>Cronus, the father of Jupiter, was in the habit of
swallowing his children at birth, but when Jupiter
was born his mother, Rhea, hid him in a cave and
gave to the unnatural father a stone wrapped in
swaddling clothes which he accepted, unaware of the
deception.</p>

<p>Jupiter grew up under the care of the nymphs,
and, after a mighty conflict, overthrew the dynasty
of the old gods and took possession of the throne
and dominion of Cronus. He was then supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
ruler of gods and men, but had viceroys of the sea
and the regions of the dead in Neptune and Pluto.
His lawful wife, Juno, reigned with him in equal
sovereignty. Their children were Mars, Vulcan and
Hebe. Although wedded to Juno, Jupiter as the
deity of the visible heavens, had brides and children
in many lands. The abode of this wisest and most
glorious of the divinities was on Mt. Olympus in the
unclouded ether.</p>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

<p>The strange story of Cronus, who swallowed
his own children, has reference to the consumption
and reproduction continually going on in nature.</p>

<p>The words Jupiter, Zeus, Jove, mean heaven,
father, almighty.</p>

<h4><span class="art">ART.</span></h4>

<p>This Carrara marble head was found at Otricoli,
a small town near Rome, in 1775, and is called the
most beautiful of all the representations of Jupiter.
The high forehead is made to appear still higher by
the lines of the hair which meet in the center in a
pointed arch. A deep furrow divides the hair from
the face. The curled beard seems admirably in
keeping with Olympian dignity.</p>

<p>The work was probably executed in Rome in
about the first century.</p>

<p>Juno’s marriage to Jupiter was one of the most

of nature and when they met as on Mt. Ida in
a golden cloud, sweet and fragrant flowers sprang up
around them.</p>

<p>It is recorded, however, that they had many
quarrels and wranglings, the blame of which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
usually traced to Juno. She was frequently angry,
jealous and quarrelsome, and her character was proud
and not free from bitterness. The Romans believed
that every woman had her Juno who protected her

warmth spreads everywhere affectionate gaiety and
blooming of new life.</p>

<h3>STORY.<br />

<span class="subhead">A PYTHIAN GOD.</span></h3>

<p>The slime with which the earth was covered by
the waters of the flood, caused so excessive a fertility
as to produce every variety of life, both good
and bad. An enormous serpent, called Python,
crept forth and lurking in the caves of Mt. Parnassus,
became the terror of the people.</p>

<p>Apollo encountered this reptile, and, after a
fearful battle, slew him with his arrows. In commemoration
of this conquest he instituted the
Pythian games, in which the victor in feats of
strength, swiftness of foot or in the chariot race, was
crowned with a wreath of beech leaves.</p>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

<p>Apollo’s conflict with the serpent, Python, is a
symbol of the victory of light and warmth over darkness
and cold. He used his bright beams (arrows)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
against the demon of darkness (Python). His
shafts slay men as does sun-stroke. Andrew Lang
relates a strange coincidence of a German scholar,
Otfried Muller, who had always opposed Apollo’s
claim to being a sun-god. He was killed by a
sun-stroke at Delphi. The god thus avenged himself
in his ancient home.</p>

<p>This statue is given the highest place of honor
in Europe’s most celebrated sculpture gallery, the
Belvedere of the Vatican. It was discovered in
1503, amid the ruins of Antium and was purchased
by Pope Julius II., who removed it to Rome.</p>

<p>It is for the modern world one of the most
popular statues of the ancient world. Though it
has been much studied and admired there has been
a question as to its exact meaning. Collignon says
that the object in the hand is a fragment of the Ægis
with the Medusa head with which Apollo routed his
enemies. Others think from the position and the
quiver strap across the breast that the god is represented
immediately after his victory over the Python.</p>

<h3>STORY.<br />

<span class="subhead">A FROZEN TRAGEDY.</span></h3>

<p>Niobe, Queen of Thebes, was the daughter of
Tantalus and wife of Amphion, who was the most
famous of mythological musicians. She was the
mother of seven sons and seven daughters. She
became jealous of the Goddess Leto and commanded
the Theban women to cease their worship of her,
explaining that she considered herself far superior to
Leto, who had but two children, while she had seven
times as many. This so angered Leto that she commanded
Apollo and Diana to kill all of Niobe’s children.
The father, Amphion, overwhelmed by this
calamity, destroyed himself. The proud mother, thus
bereft of husband and children, wept continually
night and day, until Jupiter turned her into stone;
yet tears continued to flow; and borne on a whirlwind
to her native mountain, she still remains a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
mass of rock from which a trickling stream flows, the
tribute to her never-ending grief.</p>

<p>This statue is attributed to Scopas. It was disinterred
in Rome in 1583 and is now in the Uffizi
Gallery, Florence.</p>

<p>It is part of a group composed of seventeen
figures—Niobe and fourteen children, a pedagogue
and a nurse. The figure of the mother clasped by
the arm of her terrified child is one of the most
admired of the ancient statues. It is the highest
instance in sculpture in which the body, itself exempt
from pain, so wonderfully reflects the tortured soul.
It ranks with the Laocoon and Apollo Belvedere as
a work of art.</p>

<h3>STORY.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE WAR GOD.</span></h3>

<p>Mars, the son of Jupiter and Juno, was born in
Thrace, a country noted for its fierce storms and
war-loving people. He had quarrelsome tastes and
delighted in the din and noise of warfare, never
questioning which side was right. Strife and
slaughter were the conditions of his existence. His
attendants, Fear, Discord, Alarm, Dread and Terror,
sympathized with him heartily and readily followed
his lead.</p>

<p>Bellona, goddess of war, watched over him
closely. She drove his chariot, warded off dangerous
blows, and in other ways protected him. The
altars of Mars and Bellona were the only ones
given up to human sacrifice.</p>

<p>The shield and sword, the spear and burning
torch are the emblems of Mars. His chosen animals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
are haunters of the battle field—the vulture
and the dog.</p>

<p>The character of this fierce god of battles had
a softer side. Although inconsistent and capricious,
he loved and was beloved by Venus, the fair goddess
of beauty.</p>

<p>The principal worshipers of Mars were Roman
soldiers who believed that he marched in person at
the head of their armies. Their exercising ground
was called the Campus Martius or field of Mars.
All the laurel crowns bestowed upon victorious
generals were placed on his statues and a bull was
their customary sacrifice to him.</p>

<p>This Mars, one of the most excellent works of

sitting in a careless, easy attitude absorbed in
reverie. It would seem to us from the little Cupid
at his feet that it is love for Venus which has

<span class="subhead">A PLASTIC TRAGEDY.</span></h3>

<p>Laocoon was a priest of Apollo at Troy and
endeavored unsuccessfully to dissuade the Trojans
from admitting into their gates the wooden horse
which the Greeks gave out was intended as a propitiatory
offering to Minerva, but in fact was filled with
Achæan chiefs who, by means of this strategem,
obtained entrance into the doomed city. Sinon, who
had been left behind when the Greeks pretended to
sail away, persuaded the Trojans that the horse
would prove a blessing and they drew it inside the
gates.</p>

Belvedere of the Vatican, where it has ever since
remained. The period of the statue is not definitely
known.</p>

<p>The right arm of the father has been incorrectly
restored. It is thought that it was originally bent
in such a way that the hand was near the back of
the head as then the general outline of the group
would be pyramidal, and the summit of the pyramid
would be the father’s head.</p>

<p>The three figures represent three acts of the
tragedy. The eldest son is still unhurt, and if we did
not know the story we might think his escape
possible.</p>

<p>In the father is seen the highest tension of
forces to free himself from the coils of the serpents.
The straining muscles, the expanded chest and head
thrown upward and backward, show his terrible effort.</p>

<p>The struggles of the younger son are weak and
pitiable, showing that resistance is at an end.</p>

<p>The expression of physical and emotional pain

sensitive natures. The scene is literally too sensational

<h3>STORY.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE BIRTH OF VENUS.</span></h3>

<p>Cradled on a great blue wave lay Venus when
discovered by the lovely sea-nymphs. They immediately
assumed her care, tenderly nursed her and
watched over her until she became a calm, splendid
woman. Her grace and beauty conquered every
heart. Oceanides, Tritons and Nereids, all gave
her rapturous admiration. At length the foster
mothers entrusted her to Zephyrus, who gently
wafted her to the island of Cyprus where she was
met by the Muses, Hours and Graces and led to the
assembly of the gods, who bent in homage to her
surpassing beauty.</p>

<p>Her power soon extended over men as well as
gods, and temples were reared in her honor upon
every shore. She had favors for some and strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
antipathies for others of the worshipers at her
shrines, and many are the stories and romances
which cluster round her name.</p>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

<p>Venus is the image of the dawn, the most
lovely of the sights of nature. In ancient times
the power of admiring was one of the greatest blessings
bestowed on mankind, and the beautiful morning,
as embodied in Venus, was, therefore, intensely
admired and worshiped.</p>

<p>This beautiful Greek original, the Venus of
Milo, has been called “the marble realization of the
dream of fair women.” While it is universally
recognized as a great work of art, nothing is definitely
known as to the period or school to which it
belongs.</p>

<p>It was discovered in 1820, by a peasant on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
Island of Melos, in the niche of a wall which had
long been buried. The French ambassador at
Constantinople purchased and presented it to Louis
XVIII., king of France, and it is now in the Louvre.</p>

<p>The statue is made of two blocks of marble
joined above the drapery which envelops the lower
limbs. The tip of the nose and the foot which
projects beyond the drapery have been restored by
modern artists. The restoration of the arms has
often been unsuccessfully attempted.</p>

<p>In spite of the mutilated limbs of this marble
Venus, she holds undisputed sway over the hearts
of all beholders.</p>

<h3>STORY.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE DEMI-GOD.</span></h3>

<p>Hercules is one of the most significant figures
in Grecian mythology. He was the son of Jupiter
by a mortal maiden named Alcmene. Juno, who
hated the children of her husband by mortal mothers,
declared war against him from his birth. Through
her decrees there were imposed upon him a succession
of desperate undertakings which are called the
Twelve Labors of Hercules. The variety and motives
of these labors make up a story which might easily
be turned into Christian allegory. Through them
we learn not only of the strength of Hercules and
his victories over monstrous evils, but also of his
frailties which he vanquished by superhuman will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

<p>Hercules is a sun hero, born of the sky (Jupiter)
and the dawn (Alcmene). His twelve great tasks
are interpreted to represent either the twelve signs
of the zodiac, the twelve months of the solar year, or
the twelve hours of daylight.</p>

<p>This colossal statue, called the Farnese Hercules,
was found in 1540 in the ruins of the baths of
Caracalla, Rome, and is now one of the chief attractions
of the Naples Museum, where it was placed by
the Farnese family in 1790. There has been much
dispute as to its origin, but the conclusion to which
criticism is now pointing is that it was executed by
Glycon in the first century.</p>

<p>The anatomy of the figure, though exaggerated
to be in keeping with the character of the hero, is
well worth study.</p>

<p>A large proportion of the statues of Praxiteles
represented the idealized beauty of women, and with
common consent it is admitted that he created the
type of Venus in his celebrated statue called the
Venus of Cnidus. There is a story that he made
two statues of her, one clothed and the other
unclothed. The choice between the two was offered
to the people of Cos, who, more modest than artistic,
selected the draped statue. The Cnidians most
joyfully bought the nude Venus and it was said to
have made the seaport town so attractive that people
flocked thither from all parts to view the beautiful
marble goddess. But this statue has perished. It
was seen in its beauty probably about 150, A. D.
All that remain are but feeble echoes of its grace.
Pausanius tells us that it was a portrait of Phryne,
who was much beloved by Praxiteles and often
served him as a model.</p>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

<p>The moral conception of Venus as goddess of
the higher and purer love, especially wedded love
and fruitfulness as opposed to mere sensual lust,
was but slowly developed in the course of ages.</p>

<h4><span class="art">ART.</span></h4>

<p>The Venus de Medici claims direct descent
from the Venus of Cnidus, and preserves some of
the sweet unconsciousness which must have been
the special charm of the original. It belongs to the
Græco-Roman period of sculpture and was executed
by Cleomenes. It was found in the ruins of Portico
Octavio, passed at once into the possession of the
Medici family, and is now in the Tribuna of the
Uffizi, Florence. Its “divinity has vanished; the
beautiful humanity alone remains.”</p>

<p>When Hercules’ twelve labors were ended he
married Dejanira and lived in peace with her for
three years. One day when they were traveling, in
crossing a river, the ferryman, a Centaur by the
name of Nessus, endeavored to carry away Dejanira,
but Hercules heard her cries and pierced the Centaur
through the heart with one of his poisoned
arrows. With dying accents Nessus professed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
repentance and begged Dejanira to take his robe
and keep it for its magic power.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the news was brought to
Dejanira that Hercules was in love with Iola and

her by the Centaur. When Hercules donned the
robe poison seized upon his frame.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lichas vainly denied all knowledge of the
treacherous deed, but Hercules, maddened by his
agony, seized him by the foot and hair and hurled
him into space. “Lichas congealed like hail in mid
air and turned to stone, then falling into the Euboic
sea became a rock which still bears his name and
retains the human form.” Hercules wrenched off
the garment, but it stuck to his flesh and with it
he tore away whole pieces of his body. In this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
condition he ascended Mt. Œta, where he built a
funeral pyre, and laying himself upon it, commanded
his son to apply the torch. The flames soon put an
end to his suffering and his spirit passed in a thunder
cloud to Olympus. Dejanira, seeing the calamity
she had unwittingly caused, took her own life.</p>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

<p>The slaughter of the Centaur by Hercules signifies
the dissipation of vapors by the sun. Dejanira,
“the destroying spouse,” is daylight, Iola the
beautiful twilight, and the bloody robe a sun cloud,
now concealing, now revealing, the mangled body of
the sun. Hercules ends his career in one grand
flame, the emblem of the sun setting in a framework
of blazing crimson clouds.</p>

<h4><span class="art">ART.</span></h4>

<p>This spirited group by Canova, in the Torloni
Palace, Rome, represents Hercules throwing Lichas
into the sky. The poisoned garment clings most
painfully to his body. The lion skin and club have
slipped to the base of the altar upon which he was
about to offer sacrifice.</p>

<span class="subhead">A HEAVENLY MESSENGER.</span></h3>

<p>The Goddess of Victory was the daughter of the
giant Pallas and the Oceanid nymph Styx. Her
attributes were a wreath, a palm branch and a trophy
of armor. Sometimes she carried a staff as a sign
of her power. She floated in the air with outstretched
wings or appeared coming down to earth—now
pointing the way to a victor, now placing a
wreath upon his brow.</p>

<p>Victory was embodied in a winged goddess. In

how picturesquely the Greek fancy personified
even passing events.</p>

<h4><span class="art">ART.</span></h4>

<p>This marble, one of the most noticeable and
interesting in the Louvre, is a colossal fragment of a
winged Victory discovered in 1863 on the Island of
Samothrace. The head, arms and feet are lacking.
The statue must originally have been at least twelve
feet high.</p>

<p>The figure seems sweeping down through the
air and in the very act of alighting. Every fold in
the floating garment has a direct purpose, at first
indistinctly manifest, then widening and finally lost
in the general mass.</p>

<p>The pediment on which the statue stood represents
the prow of a ship, and makes it clear that it
was executed to commemorate a naval victory of the
Athenians off Cyprus, 306 B. C. As restored by
Zumbusch, Nike holds in one hand a trumpet and in
the other a rod intended to support the trophies.</p>

<p>They exercised a great influence over human

time spinning a thread of gold, silver or wool—now
tightening, now slackening, and at last cutting it
off. This occupation was so arranged that Clotho

<h3>STORY.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE HERO OF THE CALYDONIAN HUNT.</span></h3>

<p>Meleager was the son of Œneus and Althea,
the king and queen of Calydon. When he was born
the three Fates foretold that the child would live no
longer than a brand then burning upon the hearth.
The mother carefully quenched the brand and hid it
away and Meleager grew to manhood.</p>

<p>Diana, thinking that she was not duly honored
by the people of Calydonia, sent a wild boar of
enormous size to lay waste the fields. The growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
corn, the vines and olive trees were trampled and
destroyed; the flocks and herds were driven hither
and thither in confusion and slaughtered. Meleager
called all the heroes of Greece to aid him in putting
this monster to death. When they assembled for
the hunt, Atalanta, a famous huntress, appeared, to
the surprise of all.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

</div>
</div>

<p>After an exciting chase, with many narrow
escapes, Atalanta first pierced the boar which was
afterwards slain by Meleager. The hero, enamoured
with the lovely huntress, bestowed upon her the
head of the animal as a trophy of his success. The
two uncles of Meleager, brothers of Althea, were
envious of this act and snatched from the maiden the
trophy she had received. Meleager, in a rage at the
insult, slew them both.</p>

<p>When Althea saw the bodies of her murdered
brothers, there came upon her a desire for vengeance
on her son, and she brought forth the brand so carefully
preserved all the years, and threw the precious
bit of wood upon the hearth. The brand was consumed
to ashes and as the last spark flickered out,
Meleager’s life was “breathed forth to the wandering
winds.” In remorse for her deed Althea took her
own life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

<p>Meleager is a solar hero. He slays the boar
(drought), loves Atalanta (dawn) and is finally slain
by his own mother (twilight). The twilight cannot
long survive the setting of the sun.</p>

<h4><span class="art">ART.</span></h4>

<p>Since the taste for classic art has existed this
statue has attracted attention. It is said that Raphael
and Michael Angelo were filled with admiration
when beholding it. There has never been any
attempt at restoration of the hand which undoubtedly
held a spear. Few heads of the hero type can be
compared with this for power of expression. Meleager’s
unparalleled virtues and his morbid passion
are both represented. The statue is probably a
Roman copy in marble of some celebrated Greek
original in bronze. It is in the Belvedere of the
Vatican.</p>

<p>Apollo was skilled in the art of music and sang
hymns of his composing to an accompaniment of
his own upon a wonderful lyre which Hermes had
made for him. He was the dearly loved leader of
the nine Muses, and was surnamed Musagetes.</p>

<p>That he should be the god both of music and
poetry does not appear strange, but that medicine
should also be assigned to his province may.

<p>As the kindly beams of the “orb of day”
(Apollo) spread light and warmth over nature there
are heard everywhere happy, joyful sounds, the
music of his lyre.</p>

<p>The sun was regarded as the natural restorer
of all life and as such his power extended over
human ailments and diseases.</p>

<h4><span class="art">ART.</span></h4>

<p>This statue was found in the ruins of the so-called
Villa of Cassius in 1774, and was added to
the Vatican collection.</p>

<p>The rich and flowing draperies in which Apollo
is clothed give the statue an almost feminine fulness
of form. Although only indifferently executed,
it has a graceful movement which renders it
impressive. It is evidently a copy of a famous
original, some critics say of Scopas.</p>

<p>The god is represented as gliding forward in
the dance in which he leads the Muses.</p>

<p>Calliope, the fairest of the Muses and their
chief representative, often appeared before the gods
and many of them fell victims to the charms of her
sweet voice and graceful manner. But of them all
she loved the bright sun god best, and many were
the verses she composed and sang in his honor.
He returned her love with ardor. She readily consented
to their union and became the proud mother
of Orpheus, who inherited from his parents great
musical and poetic gifts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

<p>Calliope, the personification of the light of day
and hence associated with Apollo, the sun god,
became naturally, as her voice was song, the goddess
of harmony and finally the Muse of epic poetry.</p>

<h4><span class="art">ART.</span></h4>

<p>This statue of the Muse, found in 1774 in the
ruins of the Villa of Cassius, and now in the
Vatican, is graceful and artistically excellent.</p>

<p>Calliope is seated, her figure slightly bent in
meditation. She holds a tablet in her left hand;
while her right is poised in a manner to enhance
the expression of thought. She seems to be debating
just how best to word her song.</p>

<p>Diana was the twin sister of Apollo. She had
many lovers, but her heart remained cold to all
of them until one calm, clear night, in bending
down from her moon-car over the shadowy, dream-like
earth, she beheld Endymion sleeping. At once
her heart was warmed by his surpassing beauty, and

Endymion the personification of sleep.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DESERTED PRINCESS.</span></h3>

<p>Minos, the king of Crete, in revenge for the
death of his son, slain by the Athenians, exacted a
yearly tribute from them of youths and maidens.
Theseus, a valiant youth of Athens, offered himself
as one of the victims of this tribute, with the intention
of slaying the Minotaur, a hideous monster
to whom Minos was in the habit of feeding his
captives. The cave in which the Minotaur was
confined was a labyrinth so constructed that no
man who entered could find means to escape before
he was met and devoured.</p>

<p>The king’s fair daughter saw and fell in love
with Theseus. She gave him a sword and a clue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
of thread so that he was enabled to slay the Minotaur
and find his way out of the labyrinth.</p>

<p>Fearing the wrath of her father, Ariadne fled

sleeping, and setting sail to his ship, was soon borne
away.</p>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

<p>Theseus is the sun: he slays the Minotaur (the
terrible monster of darkness), and carries off Ariadne

who love the sun god, and must be abandoned.</p>

<h4><span class="art">ART.</span></h4>

<p>The eventful sleep of Ariadne on the Island of
Naxos, during which Theseus deserted her, is here
represented. It is an unquiet sleep as denoted by
the attitude and the disorder of the beautiful but
complicated drapery. The uneven surface, upon
which the body reclines, causes it to be slightly
drawn together, and adds to the idea of unrest.
The gentle droop of the head, the relaxed, curving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
arms, and the languid air of sleep make the figure
extremely graceful and feminine, though almost
colossal in size.</p>

<h3>STORY.<br />

<span class="subhead">MARRIAGE OF BACCHUS AND ARIADNE.</span></h3>

<p>The island where Ariadne was left when
deserted by Theseus was a favorite haunt of Bacchus,
the young god of wine. In wandering over the
rocks one day, he came across Ariadne as she sat
lamenting her fate. Her distress appealed to him,
and in consoling her he became charmed with her
beauty. His devotion and admiration caused her to
forget her faithless lover, and, after a short courtship,
Bacchus won her for his wife.</p>

<p>The bridegroom presented the bride with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
golden crown adorned with seven glittering gems.
Shortly after the marriage, however, Ariadne sickened
and died. The broken-hearted Bacchus took the
crown and flung it into space, where, growing in
brightness, it became a beautiful constellation known
as Ariadne’s crown or corona.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indentq">“And still her sign is seen in heaven,</div>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

<p>As the female semblance of Bacchus, Ariadne
appears to have been a promoter of vegetation.
She alternated between the joy of spring and the
melancholy of winter. By some mythologists she is
thought to have been connected with star-worship.</p>

<h4><span class="art">ART.</span></h4>

<p>This statue is the most celebrated work of the
distinguished German sculptor, Dannecker (1758–1841).
It is known to many people the world over
through the generosity of Herr Bethmann of Frankfort,
who admits visitors to his gallery, and from the
many casts and pictures made of it.</p>

<p>The author did not choose the more touching
and poetic character in which to represent Ariadne.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
She is here no longer the deserted and desolate one,
but the triumphant bride of the god of the vintage.</p>

<p>The figure, which is larger than life, reclines on
the back of a clumsy panther. The body and limbs
are finely modeled, and the attitude is graceful and
pleasing. Some critic has remarked that this statue
makes the conduct of Theseus inexcusable.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Minerva was the daughter of Jupiter and was
said to have leaped forth from his brain mature and
in complete armor. She was warlike in her tendencies,
but it was defensive war only with which
she was in sympathy.</p>

<p>As a goddess of storms and battles the Greeks
called her Athene, and as she also possessed gentle
characteristics, she was styled Pallas.</p>

<p>She was the goddess of wisdom, of weaving and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
of agriculture, and was forever a virgin, scorning
the affections which were frequently offered her.
As the especial divinity of the people of Athens she
put to flight a deity named Dullness, who had ruled
there.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Ere Pallas issued from the Thunderer’s head,</div>

</div>

<p>Many temples and altars were dedicated to
Minerva, the most celebrated of all being the Parthenon
at Athens.</p>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

<p>Minerva is a dawn goddess. Her Greek name,
Athene, from the Sanskrit <i>ahana</i>, means the “light
of daybreak.” She springs from the “dark forehead
of the broad heavens,” searches out the dark corners,
and fills all with her light. This conception of penetrating
scrutiny passes readily into the idea of
wisdom. The Latin <i>Minerva</i>, is connected with
<i>mens</i>, the English <i>mind</i>.</p>

<h4><span class="art">ART.</span></h4>

<p>It is easy to recognize statues of Minerva, as
she wears an ægis or mantle of goatskin (the
emblem of the storm-cloud), the clasp of which is
the head of Medusa, won for her by Perseus. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
has been suggested that this head so worn has an
inner meaning, and that it is intended for a symbol
of evil which, though always present, may be made
powerless by virtue.</p>

<p>This well executed statue of Minerva in the
Capitol, Rome, is a direct offspring of the colossal
creation in ivory and gold by Phidias which stood
in the Parthenon. The energetic, warlike figure is
short and thick-set. The folds of the drapery,
especially that of the upper garment, are sharp
and angular.</p>

<p>Orpheus and his beloved wife, Eurydice, were
constant companions, but one day Eurydice trod
upon a poisonous snake, was bitten on the foot, and
soon died. Her spirit was borne into Hades by
Mercury. The husband, left desolate, boldly made
his way into the land of shadows, presented himself
before the throne of Pluto and Proserpine, and, with
the aid of his lyre, persuaded them to again unite
the thread of Eurydice’s life.</p>

<p>Eurydice was permitted to return to earth on

regions of the dead, he should not look behind him.
Conducted by Mercury, they had all but passed the
fatal limits of that gloomy world when Orpheus, no

and so lost once more and forever his beloved
Eurydice.</p>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

<p>Eurydice, whose name comes from a Sanskrit
word denoting the broad-spreading blush of dawn
across the sky, is a personification of that light
slain by the serpent of darkness at twilight.</p>

<p>Orpheus is sometimes considered as the sun,
and the dawn (Eurydice) reappears opposite the
place where he disappeared; as the dawn is no longer
seen after the sun has fairly risen, the ancients said,
“Orpheus has turned round too soon to look at
Eurydice, and so is parted from the wife he loves.”</p>

<h4><span class="art">ART.</span></h4>

<p>This marble relief, in the Villa Albani, Naples,
is a fine illustration of one of the leading principles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
of Greek art—extreme moderation in the expression
of passion. The greatest grief is most delicately
yet most intensely expressed by a few voiceless
gestures.</p>

<p>Orpheus, guided by Mercury, is leading Eurydice
back from Hades. Contrary to his contract, he
turns with irresistible longing to look at her before
they are entirely past the portals. Eurydice lovingly
puts her hand on his shoulder. But now their
parting must come. Orpheus’ bitterness at his fate
is expressed by his hand, which moves toward the
hand of his beloved. Mercury, sad and pitying,
takes her by the other hand to lead her again “down
the darkling ways.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Bacchus, the youngest of the gods, was the son
of Jupiter and Semele. His mother, instigated by
the jealous Juno, who appeared to her in disguise,
demanded of Jupiter that he should reveal himself
to her in all his power and majesty. Jupiter unwillingly
complied and, making his thunder bolts milder
than usual, appeared before her. The lightning
which played about his head set fire to the palace
and Semele was consumed. The child, Bacchus,
was snatched from the flames by his brother Mercury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
and borne away to the nymphs, who guarded
him most faithfully.</p>

<p>While still a youth Bacchus was appointed god
of wine. Spring was a season of gladness for him,
winter a time of sorrow. He delighted in roaming
over the world borne by his followers or riding in
his chariot drawn by wild beasts. His train was
composed of men and women, nymphs, fauns and
satyrs who drank wine made from water and sunshine,
ate grapes, and sang the praises of their
leader.</p>

Bacchus is regarded as the spiritual form of the new

<p>The orgies were but a poetic incarnation of
blithe, spiritual youth. The idea of Bacchus is not
a simple one. His many titles have given rise to
an almost endless number of variations of his

complicated.</p>

<p>Of the many representations of Bacchus this

simple, delicate and beautiful. The child Bacchus
is carried on the shoulders of a faun. He holds a

the faun with the other. The faun is playing on
cymbals and looks back and up at Bacchus with a
happy smile.</p>

<p>One bright morning Daphne, a charming nymph
with flowing hair and sparkling eyes, was sporting in
the forest. Apollo, passing by, saw the maiden and
forthwith fell in love with her. He longed to obtain
her, but before he could reach her side she fled. He
called to her to dismiss her fears and listen to
his love. He assured her of his sincerity, of his

ground. A rough bark enclosed her quivering

invested her whole body. Her trembling hands

</div>

<p>Pluto, the king of Hades, stole Proserpine from
her mother, Ceres, while she was playing in the
flowery fields and bore her away to reign with him
as his queen in the gloomy regions of the dead.
For days the sorrowing mother wandered far and
wide searching for her dearly loved child. The
earth which had so long obtained her favors was
neglected. The cattle died, the seed failed to germinate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
there was drought, thistles and brambles
were the only growth and famine threatened the
people.</p>

<p>One day a water nymph, who heard the lament
of Ceres, told her that as she had passed through the
lower parts of the earth in her endeavor to escape
from a too ardent lover, she had seen Proserpine
reigning as the bride of the monarch there.</p>

<p>Ceres hastened to Jupiter and implored him to
restore her daughter, promising that when she
beheld her again the earth should be restored to
fruitfulness, and</p>

<p>But the release of Proserpine was not complete.
Jupiter’s law must be obeyed, but Pluto, before he
let her go, persuaded her to eat a morsel of pomegranate
by which he cast upon her a spell that
would oblige her to return to him, for half of the
year, while the other half she could spend with her
mother. As soon as Proserpine returned to earth
Ceres cheerfully and diligently attended to her duties
and all was blessed with plenty. But when six
months were gone all nature mourned and wept, for
Proserpine left the bright world and returned to the
darkness of Hades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

<p>Pluto, “the unseen,” “the wealth giver,” greedily
drew all things down to his dismal abode.
Hades was a prison or storehouse containing the
germs of all future harvests, and in spite of its
darkness was regarded as a land of great riches.
Ceres, the earth mother, expresses the gloom which
falls on the earth during the cheerless months
of winter. Proserpine, spring, typifies the yearly
blooming of the flowers and the growth of the corn
from the seed, and hence was obliged to dwell in the
dismal underworld during the dark days of winter,
but could return with each spring to give gladness
and fertility to the mourning earth.</p>

<h4><span class="art">ART.</span></h4>

<p>This group, called the “Rape of Proserpine,”
the work of Bernini, is in the Villa Ludovisi, Rome.
It has received much adverse criticism, but has also
been greatly admired. It represents Pluto holding
Proserpine in his brawny arms and, in spite of her
struggles, carrying her off to Hades. In artistic
excellence it does not compare with “Apollo and
Daphne,” which Bernini executed much earlier in
life.</p>

<p>Although nursed with tender solicitude, he did
not grow as other children, but remained a small,
rosy, chubby child with gauzy wings and dimpled
face. Alarmed for his health, Venus consulted
Themis (Law), who oracularly replied, “He is solitary;
if he had a brother he would grow apace.”
In vain the goddess strove to catch the subtile
significance of the answer. When Anteros, god of
passion, was born, the secret was revealed. When
with his brother, Cupid grew until he became a
graceful, slender youth, but when away from him he
always resumed his childlike form and bewildering
pranks.</p>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

<p>Cupid was the lord of the dawn. To a youthful
race of men love was like a “morn radiating with
heavenly splendor over their souls, pervading their
hearts with a glowing warmth, purifying their whole
being like a fresh breeze, and illuminating the whole
world around them with a new light.” To express<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
this feeling, the dawn of love, there was but one
similitude,—the blush of day, the rising of the sun.
They said “The sun has risen” where we say “I
love.”</p>

<h4><span class="art">ART.</span></h4>

<p>Cupid makes one of the most attractive subjects
in sculpture. We know him at a glance, whether
beside his mother, with Psyche, or alone.</p>

<p>The Cupid of the illustration is the work of
Michael Angelo. It was discovered forty years ago
hidden away in the cellars of the Ruccelli Palace,
Florence, and passed by purchase into the possession
of the English nation and is now in the South
Kensington Museum.</p>

<p>Cupid is seen in the statue as a well-grown
youth, a noble conception of the young god. He
seems to stand for a love that is determined, for a
love that conquers every obstacle. He has dropped
on one knee to take an arrow from the ground. In
his raised left hand he holds the bow.</p>

<p>Perseus, the sun, “destroyer of evil and noxious
things,” is forced by Polydictes, darkness, to journey
to the home of the Gorgons, gloaming, and conquer
Medusa, the star-lit heaven marred by ghastly
vapors which stream like dark serpents across it.</p>

<h4><span class="art">ART.</span></h4>

<p>This Perseus, by Canova, is in the Belvedere
of the Vatican. It is a beautifully finished statue
in which the artist evidently imitated the Apollo
Belvedere. The head of Medusa is that of a young
and lovely woman, with the serpents arranged about
her face like curling hair—yet Canova has succeeded
in giving her that expression of “freezing
disdain which pierces the very soul.”</p>

<h3>STORY.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE CUP-BEARER.</span></h3>

<p>Hebe was the daughter of Jupiter and Juno.
She waited upon the gods and filled their cups with
nectar with which it was their wont to pledge
each other. But one day she awkwardly tripped
and fell, and was forced to resign her office to
Ganymede.</p>

<p>She married Hercules after he was received
among the gods. Later traditions represent her as
a divinity who had it in her power to make aged
persons young again.</p>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

<p>Hebe, the goddess of youth, embodies the fleeting
nature of human existence, particularly the delightful
and elusive stage of youth.</p>

<p>This poetic creation in the National Gallery,

Hebe is purely beautiful as she springs away like
the joy of youth. The light drapery does not interfere
with the floating movement. In one hand she
lifts high the vase of ambrosia, and in the other
holds a goblet.</p>

<p>Jupiter was obliged to go in quest of another
cup bearer to replace Hebe after she resigned her
position. To facilitate this search, he assumed the
form of an eagle and winged his flight over the
earth. He had not flown far when he beheld Ganymede,
a youth of marvelous beauty, alone on Mt.
Ida. To swoop down, clutch him in his mighty
talons and bear him safely off to Olympus, was the
work of but a few moments. There the kidnapped
youth, the son of the king of Troy, was carefully
taught the duties he was called upon to perform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

<p>Like Hebe, Ganymede personifies youth.
Astronomers place him among the stars under
the name of Aquarius. There is but little growth
of mythical tradition about his personality.</p>

<p>This pleasing composition, referred by critics to
the Alexandrian period, now in the Naples Museum,
shows Ganymede standing by the side of the eagle
and passing his arm about the bird’s neck. The
eagle is placed on a stump so as to bring his head
nearer to a level with the boy’s arm.</p>

<p>Psyche was the youngest of three daughters of
a king and by her beauty incurred the jealousy and
envy of Venus, who commanded her son, Cupid, to
slay her. Cupid prepared to obey the command, but
became so stricken with Psyche’s beauty that he fell
in love with her and sent a Zephyr to convey her to
a splendid palace where he became her husband.
He visited her, however, only when the shades of
night fell and entreated her to make no attempt to
discover his name or see his face, warning her that
if she did he would be forced to leave her, never to
return.</p>

a hideous monster, but the most beautiful of the
gods. In the excitement of joy and fear, a drop of
hot oil fell from the lamp upon his shoulder. He

<p>Psyche, disconsolate, wandered over the earth

imposed upon her the hardest and most humiliating
labors. She would have perished but that Cupid,
who still loved her in secret, invisibly comforted her.
One day he found her asleep by the roadside with
the marks of grief upon her lovely face. He softly
kissed her and said:</p>

<span class="subhead">THE THEFT.</span></h3>

<p>Mercury was remarkable for his dexterity and
cunning. On the day of his birth he stole the
“immortal oxen” of Apollo and drove them off to
a secluded spot where he concealed them. When
Apollo missed his cattle he began to search for
some clue to their hiding place or to the thief, but
found nothing except a few broken limbs and
scattered twigs.</p>

<p>Suddenly he remembered that the babe whose
birth had been announced that morning in high
Olympus, had been appointed god of thieves. He
soon discovered the young rogue hidden away in his
cradle. Mercury put on a pretty air of innocence
and denied all knowledge of the cattle; but Apollo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
was not easily deceived. He took the thief to
Jupiter, who ordered him to make restitution. Mercury
gave his lyre to Apollo who presented him in
return with the divining rod, which afterwards
became the caduceus, and they were then the best
of friends.</p>

<p>Although Mercury in his lowest aspects was an
accomplished liar and cunning thief, he was at the
same time a swift and trusted messenger of the
gods, the fair youth of whom Homer speaks:</p>

<p>“Straightway beneath his feet he bound his fair
golden sandals divine that bore him over the wet
sea and o’er the boundless land with the breathings
of the wind.”</p>

<p>Mercury, when commissioned by the “high
thundering Zeus” to perform an errand much to
his distaste, thus soliloquizes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Much must he toil who serves the Immortal Gods,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I, who am their herald, most of all</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Unclasp the winged sandals from my feet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than I again must clasp them, and depart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon some foolish errand.”</div>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

drive away the clouds and conceal them, leaving no
trace of his passage except broken branches and
scattered leaves. His swiftness, his strength and
his persuasive powers make him an ideal messenger.</p>

<h3>STORY.<br />

<span class="subhead">THANATOS.</span></h3>

<p>Thanatos, or Mors, the god of Death and twin
brother of Sleep dwelt in a dark cavern near the
entrance to Tartarus. His office was to introduce
all men to the subterranean abode and reveal to
them its secrets. Occasionally he was followed
with meekness and submission, but more often his
approach was regarded with fear. He performed
his task with such relentless severity that at the
sight of his gloomy figure men’s hearts trembled
and their minds were filled with awful thoughts.</p>

<h4><span class="art">ART.</span></h4>

<p>The god of death has often been represented
in art as a hideous, cadaverous looking deity, clad in
a winding sheet and holding an hour glass and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
scythe. We have a more attractive personification
in Canova’s “Genius of Death,” a detail of the tomb
of Clement XIII., in St. Peter’s, Rome.</p>

<p>The beautiful, pensive youth is sitting in a
quiet, restful attitude holding an extinguished torch.
The sleeping lion at his feet adds to the general air
of repose.</p>

<h3>STORY.<br />

<span class="subhead">THREE CHARITIES.</span></h3>

<p>Three sisters, Euphrosyne, Aglaia, and Thalia,
in fair Venus’ train with the “rosy bosomed Hours,”
were goddesses who enhanced the enjoyments of life
by refinement and gentleness. They were young
and modest maidens always dancing, singing or running,
or decking themselves with flowers. Their
home was on Mt. Olympus where they often danced
before the deities. The Greeks believed that labor
without gracefulness was in vain, and so Minerva,
who presided over the serious business of life, often
called in the aid of the Graces. They also assisted
Mercury in his capacity of god of oratory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

<p>The manifold beauty which the works of
nature, especially in spring time, display would
seem to have given rise in early times to a belief in
the existence of certain goddesses at first simply as
guardians of the vernal sweetness and beauty of
nature, and afterward as the friends and protectors
of everything graceful and beautiful. Purity and
happiness in life and gratitude among men were
associated with them. The name “Gratiæ,” or
“Charites,” signifies the exercise of kind affection,
or the charities of life.</p>

<h4><span class="art">ART.</span></h4>

<p>These figures of the Graces by Canova, in the
Borghese Gallery, Rome, are classic in outline and
refined in treatment. They show not a trace of
sensuality. Many artists have delighted in reproducing
this type of the Graces.</p>

<h3>STORY.<br />

<span class="subhead">AN ARCADIAN GOD.</span></h3>

<p>Pan was god of the woods and fields, flocks and
shepherds, and his favorite residence was Arcadia.
He was fond of music and led the dances of the
Hours and Graces.</p>

<p>The story goes that a coy nymph whom he
loved and endeavored to gain was changed into a
reed which he cut and fashioned into the Syrinx or
Pan’s pipe. With this he charmed trees and flowers
as well as men and animals.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Although Pan had a pleasant, cheerful face, he
was curiously formed, having a man’s body and a
goat’s legs and feet. He was supposed to delight in
inspiring people with sudden and unfounded fears—hence
the word <i>panic</i>.</p>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

<p>The character of Pan was symbolic of Nature;
the music of his pipes was the gentle, intermittent
breeze.</p>

<p>The lower part of his body was that of a goat
on account of the rough and rocky nature of his
favorite haunts. His leaf-shaped ears—terminating
in little peaks like those of some animals—indicate
his wild, forest nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<h4><span class="art">ART.</span></h4>

<p>The face and figure of Pan as displayed in this
statue by Fremiet, in the Luxembourg, give an idea
of an easy, amiable creature. It is impossible to
gaze long at it without conceiving a kindly sentiment
towards it. The nose is almost straight, but
curves inward slightly, giving the face a good-humored
charm. The mouth seems so nearly to
smile outright that one involuntarily smiles in
return.</p>

<p>Jupiter so grudged fire to mortals that he
became furious with anger and in revenge ordered
Vulcan to fashion a woman out of clay and send
her to man to bring misery upon him.</p>

<p>The woman was named Pandora and on her
were bestowed all the charms and weaknesses of
human nature. Mercury led her to Epimetheus
who, though warned by his brother Prometheus
not to accept any gifts from the gods, succumbed
at once to her beauty and made her his wife. He
conveyed her to his home, where all went merrily
until Pandora discovered a box hidden away in her
husband’s house. She was seized with a curiosity
to know its contents, but Epimetheus forbade her to
meddle with it.</p>

  <div class="attrib">—<i>Longfellow.</i></div>

<p>The allurement proved too great, however.
Stealthily she raised the lid to take a peep within
and lo, out flew a multitude of plagues and scattered
themselves over the earth to forever torment hapless
man with diseases, vices and crimes. All that remained
was Hope. After many entreaties she came
forth to heal the wounds inflicted by her former
fellow prisoners. “Thus entered evil into the world
bringing untold misery: thus followed Hope to
point to a happier future.”</p>

<h4><span class="int">INTERPRETATION.</span></h4>

<p>The progress of civilization is symbolized by
fire and its adaptation to the uses of mankind.</p>

<p>Prometheus means forethought or Providence;
Epimetheus afterthought. To be wise after an
event is often to be wise too late. The temptation
of Epimetheus came in the form of Pandora (all
gifts), and was too fascinating to be resisted.</p>

<p>Diseases and evils can do no harm until they
are let loose.</p>

<h4><span class="art">ART.</span></h4>

<p>Thorwaldsen possessed in a remarkable degree
the genuine antique spirit and in this figure of Hope
he has embodied the calm simplicity and cheerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
repose which make the key note of the best Greek
sculpture. There is about it a noble charm which
seems to be a reflex of an inward purity. The
smile Hope wears is delicately expressive of her
name.</p>
